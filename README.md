Welcome to My Cybersecurity Portfolio


About Me


Hello! I’m Adoniyah Brown, a dedicated and driven Security Operations Center (SOC) Analyst with over 4
years of experience in cybersecurity, technical support, and threat management. I am passionate about
protecting digital environments and minimizing security risks through proactive measures, continuous
monitoring, and incident response. Currently, I am pursuing a Bachelor’s in Cybersecurity & Information
Assurance at Western Governors University to enhance my skills and knowledge further.
