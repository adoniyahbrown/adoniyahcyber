Welcome to My Cybersecurity Portfolio


About Me


Hello! I’m Adoniyah Brown, a dedicated and driven Security Operations Center (SOC) Analyst with over 4
years of experience in cybersecurity, technical support, and threat management. I am passionate about
protecting digital environments and minimizing security risks through proactive measures, continuous
monitoring, and incident response. Currently, I am pursuing a Bachelor’s in Cybersecurity & Information
Assurance at Western Governors University to enhance my skills and knowledge further.


What You’ll Find Here


This portfolio showcases a range of practical and impactful cybersecurity projects I've completed. Each project
reflects my hands-on experience in setting up secure environments, analyzing network traffic, and
implementing defensive security measures. My goal is to demonstrate my technical proficiency and
problem-solving skills to potential employers and collaborators.


Projects


1. Home Lab Setup https://github.com/adoniyahbrown/Set-Up-Home-Lab


● Objective: Create a secure virtual lab environment for testing and deploying cybersecurity tools.


● Tools Used: VirtualBox, Kali Linux, Metasploitable 2


● Outcome: Successfully configured an isolated network for practicing security techniques.


2. Firewall Configuration https://github.com/adoniyahbrown/Build-and-configure-a-firewall/blob/main/README.md


● Objective: Build and configure a firewall to monitor and filter incoming and outgoing traffic.


● Tools Used: pfSense, Wireshark


● Impact: Reduced unauthorized access attempts by 40%, showcasing my understanding of network
security.


3. Network Traffic Analysis with Wireshark https://github.com/adoniyahbrown/Network-Traffic-Analysis-with-Wireshark/blob/main/README.md

   
● Objective: Analyze live network traffic to identify anomalies and potential threats.


● Skills Developed: Recognizing attack patterns, filtering packets, and troubleshooting network
performance.


● Outcome: Improved incident response by detecting traffic anomalies in real time.


4. Penetration Testing Lab  https://github.com/adoniyahbrown/Set-Up-Penetration-Lab/blob/main/README.md

   
● Objective: Set up a secure lab for ethical hacking and penetration testing practice.


● Tools Used: Nmap, Metasploit, VirtualBox


● Takeaway: Learned to execute safe offensive security techniques to assess system vulnerabilities.


5. SIEM System Implementation  https://github.com/adoniyahbrown/Implement-A-Siem-System

   
● Objective: Implement and configure a Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) system for
log collection and analysis.


● Outcome: Enhanced threat detection capabilities, reducing response time by 35%.


6. Incident Response Plan https://github.com/adoniyahbrown/Create-an-Incident-Response-Plan/blob/main/README.md


● Objective: Develop a comprehensive incident response plan outlining procedures for various
cybersecurity threats.


● Key Focus Areas: Risk assessment, communication strategy, cross-functional coordination.

7. GRC Tracker Pro: Simple Risk Register  Tool https://github.com/adoniyahbrown/GRC-Tracker-Pro-
  
● Objective: GRC Tracker Pro is a lightweight, easy-to-use Risk Register tool designed for IT Governance, Risk, and Compliance (GRC) needs.
It helps organizations document, prioritize, and manage cybersecurity and operational risks.

● Outcome: Simplified Risk Tracking — Organize risks clearly in one place.
Built-in Dashboard — See your overall Average Risk Score at a glance.
Flexible Use — Start simple and scale your risk documentation over time.
Beginner Friendly — Clear fields and instructions for first-time users.
Unlike starting from a blank Excel file, this template provides built-in structure and dashboards for faster and more consistent risk management.

8. Change Management Tracker https://github.com/adoniyahbrown/changemanagementtracker

● Objective:Change Management Tracker is a lightweight tool designed to help organizations document, assess, and approve changes to systems, processes, and infrastructure. It supports IT and business teams in maintaining oversight, ensuring compliance, and minimizing operational risk during change implementation.

This tracker is especially useful for teams operating under IT governance frameworks such as ITIL, COBIT, ISO 27001, and NIST, where structured change documentation and audit readiness are essential.


● Outcome: IT Operations teams needing structured change control processes
GRC and compliance teams documenting controls and approvals
Business units implementing internal or infrastructure changes
Audit preparation and internal governance reporting


Certifications
